# Climate--Forecast-Temperature
Gaining massive temperature data from kaggle, I first did data cleaning and found out several missing value. Therefore, tried several methods to deal with this situation and concluded that winter's model for forecasting missing value is the best solution.  
After gaining a clean data, I tried winter's model to forecast the next five year temperature and the model performed well with 2.4% MAPE.
Due to storage limitations, I'll provide the link for reference:
